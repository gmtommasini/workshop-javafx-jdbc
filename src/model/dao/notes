xxxDAO is the generic INTERFACE used by the program linked to the object entity.
DAOfactory is the class responsible for creating instances of the xxxDAO


Factory is the only class from the program itself that knows with technology is being used to connect to DB. 
If the technology changes, we just need to modify this class, apart of the specific classes for that tech (DB and xxxDaoJDBC).
true?
